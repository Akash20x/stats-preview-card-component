## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Though my main focus was on building I also learned so much about design in general (font-sizes, colors etc).
Also, I had some experience with Figma before but with this assignment I definitely feel more comfortable working with it.
I have so much yet to learn and to develop my skills - the learning never stops! :-)
